        Schneider Electric’s One Digital Grid Platform is a next-generation AI-enabled software suite designed to help
        utilities modernize and operate the electrical grid more efficiently. By unifying grid planning, operations, and
        asset management into a single interoperable environment, the platform allows utilities to improve visibility
        across distributed energy resources while reducing operational complexity. The system runs on a hybrid Microsoft
        Azure cloud architecture and leverages real-time analytics to detect grid issues, automate routine workflows,
        and support faster decision-making. This improves reliability, enables renewable energy integration, and cuts
        the time required to resolve outages. According to Schneider Electric, utilities adopting One Digital Grid have
        achieved up to a 20% reduction in outage penalties, a 65% decrease in operator time during outage events, and up
        to 35% faster resolution of field issues. A Forrester economic impact study further highlights a projected 184%
        return on investment with a 16-month payback period, demonstrating the platform’s effectiveness in reducing
        costs while strengthening grid resilience and flexibility for future energy demands.

    <h2>Technical overview of this project (W34)</h2>
    <p class="technical">
      This demo application (W34) is built using an Angular Single Page Application for the frontend and a Node.js/Express
      backend written in TypeScript. The backend exposes authenticated REST endpoints, issues JSON Web Tokens (JWT) after
      login, and stores data in a MongoDB database named <strong>SchneiderElectric</strong>. The Angular frontend consumes
      these APIs over HTTP, renders interactive visualizations with Chart.js, and protects routes through a simple
      authentication guard and interceptor. Both frontend and backend are deployed on a single DigitalOcean droplet: the
      Angular build is served by NGINX on port 80, while the Node/Express API runs on port 3000 as a system service. This
      architecture mirrors a real-world production stack and demonstrates modern full-stack web development practices.
